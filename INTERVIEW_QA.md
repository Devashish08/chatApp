## Project Overview

### Q1: Can you explain what this chat application does?
**Answer:** This is a terminal-based, multithreaded client-server chat application built with Java Socket Programming. It allows multiple clients to connect to a central server and exchange private messages in real-time. The server acts as a message broker, routing messages between clients based on recipient names.

### Q2: What are the main components of this application?
**Answer:** 
- **Server.java**: Main server class that accepts client connections and spawns handler threads
- **Client.java**: Client application that connects to server and handles user input/output
- **CommunicationHandler.java**: Server-side thread handler that manages individual client connections and message routing

### Q3: What design pattern does this application follow?
**Answer:** It follows the **Producer-Consumer** pattern with **Thread-per-Connection** model:
- Server produces connection handlers for each client
- Each CommunicationHandler consumes messages from its client
- It also uses **Observer pattern** implicitly (server observes client connections)

## Java Fundamentals

### Q4: Explain the use of `implements Runnable` in both Client and CommunicationHandler classes.
**Answer:** 
- `Runnable` interface allows these classes to be executed in separate threads
- **CommunicationHandler**: Each client connection runs in its own thread for concurrent message handling
- **Client**: Separates the client logic from the main thread, allowing for better resource management
- Using `Runnable` is preferred over extending `Thread` class because Java supports single inheritance

### Q5: What is the purpose of the `Vector<CommunicationHandler> loggedInClients`?
**Answer:**
- **Vector** is a thread-safe collection that stores all active client handlers
- **Thread-safe**: Multiple threads can safely add/remove clients without data corruption
- **Static**: Shared across all CommunicationHandler instances to maintain global client list
- Used for message routing (finding recipient) and user management

### Q6: Why is Vector used instead of ArrayList?
**Answer:**
- **Vector is synchronized** - thread-safe for concurrent access
- **ArrayList is not thread-safe** - would cause race conditions with multiple threads
- Alternative could be `Collections.synchronizedList()` or `ConcurrentHashMap`

### Q7: Explain the StringTokenizer usage in the message parsing.
**Answer:**
```java
StringTokenizer senderMessage = new StringTokenizer(inputMessageFromClient, "-");
StringTokenizer messageTokens = new StringTokenizer(messageContent.nextToken(), "#:");
```
- **First tokenizer**: Splits client input by "-" to separate client name from message
- **Second tokenizer**: Splits message by ":" to separate recipient from message content
- **Alternative**: Could use `String.split()` but StringTokenizer is more memory efficient for simple parsing

## Socket Programming

### Q8: Explain the socket connection process in this application.
**Answer:**
1. **Server**: Creates `ServerSocket` on specified port
2. **Server**: Calls `accept()` to wait for client connections (blocking call)
3. **Client**: Creates `Socket` connection to server's IP and port
4. **Server**: `accept()` returns new `Socket` for each client
5. **Both**: Use `InputStream`/`OutputStream` for bidirectional communication

### Q9: What is the difference between ServerSocket and Socket?
**Answer:**
- **ServerSocket**: Server-side socket that listens for incoming connections on a port
- **Socket**: Represents an endpoint of a network connection (both client and server use this for communication)
- **ServerSocket.accept()** creates new Socket instances for each client connection

### Q10: Explain the I/O streams used in this application.
**Answer:**
```java
// Server side (CommunicationHandler)
BufferedReader clientInputStream = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));
PrintWriter clientOutputStream = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream()));

// Client side
PrintWriter outputStream = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream());
BufferedReader response = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));
```
- **BufferedReader**: Efficient text reading with buffering
- **PrintWriter**: Convenient text output with auto-flush options
- **InputStreamReader/OutputStreamWriter**: Convert byte streams to character streams

### Q11: Why is `flush()` called after writing messages?
**Answer:**
- **Buffering**: PrintWriter buffers output for efficiency
- **Immediate delivery**: `flush()` forces immediate transmission of buffered data
- **Real-time chat**: Essential for instant message delivery
- **Network programming**: Prevents messages from being held in buffer indefinitely

## Multithreading & Concurrency

### Q12: Explain the threading model used in this application.
**Answer:**
- **Server**: Main thread accepts connections, spawns new thread for each client
- **CommunicationHandler**: Each runs in separate thread to handle client messages
- **Client**: Uses 3 threads:
  - Main thread for connection setup
  - Sender thread for user input
  - Receiver thread for incoming messages

### Q13: Why does the client need separate sender and receiver threads?
**Answer:**
- **Non-blocking I/O**: User can type while receiving messages simultaneously
- **Concurrent operations**: Reading from socket and user input concurrently
- **Responsive UI**: Prevents blocking when waiting for user input or network data
- **Full-duplex communication**: Send and receive operations don't interfere

### Q14: What are the potential concurrency issues in this code?
**Answer:**
1. **Vector operations**: Though Vector is synchronized, compound operations aren't atomic
2. **Shared state**: Multiple threads accessing `loggedInClients` simultaneously
3. **Resource cleanup**: Thread termination and socket cleanup timing
4. **Message ordering**: No guarantee of message delivery order between threads

### Q15: How would you handle race conditions in the client list management?
**Answer:**
```java
// Current approach - basic synchronization
synchronized(loggedInClients) {
    // Find and remove client
}

// Better approach - use ConcurrentHashMap
ConcurrentHashMap<String, CommunicationHandler> clients = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

// Or use explicit locks
private final ReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
```

### Q16: Explain thread cleanup in the CommunicationHandler.
**Answer:**
```java
try {
    clientSocket.close();
    clientInputStream.close();
    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
} catch (IOException e) {
    throw new RuntimeException(e);
}
```
- **Resource cleanup**: Closes socket and input stream
- **Thread interruption**: Signals thread to stop execution
- **Finally block**: Should be used to ensure cleanup happens
- **Memory leaks**: Proper cleanup prevents resource leaks

## Object-Oriented Programming

### Q17: Explain the encapsulation used in this project.
**Answer:**
- **Private fields**: `portNumber`, `clientName`, `socket` etc. are private
- **Public methods**: `startServer()`, `run()` provide controlled access
- **Lombok annotations**: `@Getter/@Setter` generate accessor methods
- **Information hiding**: Internal implementation details are hidden

### Q18: What is the purpose of the constructor overloading in CommunicationHandler?
**Answer:**
```java
// Main constructor for actual clients
public CommunicationHandler(Socket clientSocket) { ... }

// Private constructor for dummy/placeholder objects
private CommunicationHandler(String name, boolean loggedInStatus) { ... }
```
- **Different initialization**: Real clients vs placeholder objects
- **Dummy objects**: Used when recipient not found
- **Design flaw**: Better to use null pattern or Optional<>

### Q19: How does polymorphism work in this application?
**Answer:**
- **Runnable interface**: Both Client and CommunicationHandler implement Runnable
- **Thread execution**: Can be passed to Thread constructor polymorphically
- **Interface segregation**: Classes implement only what they need
```java
Thread client = new Thread(new CommunicationHandler(socket)); // Polymorphism
Thread cl = new Thread(new Client("localhost", port, userName)); // Polymorphism
```

## System Design

### Q20: What are the scalability limitations of this design?
**Answer:**
1. **Thread-per-connection**: Limited by OS thread limits (~1000-10000)
2. **Memory usage**: Each thread consumes ~1MB stack space
3. **CPU overhead**: Context switching between many threads
4. **Blocking I/O**: Threads block on read operations
5. **Centralized server**: Single point of failure

### Q21: How would you improve the scalability?
**Answer:**
1. **NIO (Non-blocking I/O)**: Use `java.nio` package with selectors
2. **Thread pools**: Use `ExecutorService` instead of creating threads
3. **Async processing**: Event-driven architecture with callbacks
4. **Load balancing**: Multiple server instances
5. **Message queues**: Decouple message processing

### Q22: Explain the message routing mechanism.
**Answer:**
```java
// Message format: "SenderName-RecipientName : Message"
// Parsing process:
1. Split by "-" to get sender and message part
2. Split message by ":" to get recipient and content
3. Find recipient in loggedInClients Vector
4. Send message to recipient's output stream
```

### Q23: What happens when a recipient is not online?
**Answer:**
- Creates dummy `CommunicationHandler` with `loggedInStatus = false`
- Sends error message back to sender
- Shows list of online users
- **Improvement**: Could queue messages for offline users

## Error Handling

### Q24: How does the application handle connection failures?
**Answer:**
- **Client retry logic**: Prompts for new port number on connection failure
- **Exception propagation**: IOExceptions are caught and handled appropriately
- **Graceful degradation**: Server continues running even if client disconnects
- **Resource cleanup**: Try-catch blocks ensure resources are closed

### Q25: What happens when a client disconnects unexpectedly?
**Answer:**
```java
inputMessageFromClient = clientInputStream.readLine();
if (inputMessageFromClient == null) {
    loggedInStatus = false;
    break;
}
```
- **Null check**: `readLine()` returns null when connection is closed
- **Cleanup**: Client is removed from `loggedInClients` Vector
- **Thread termination**: Handler thread exits gracefully
- **Notification**: Server logs disconnection with timestamp

### Q26: How could you improve error handling?
**Answer:**
1. **Specific exceptions**: Handle different exception types differently
2. **Retry mechanisms**: Automatic reconnection for clients
3. **Logging framework**: Use Log4j/SLF4J instead of System.out.println
4. **Error codes**: Define standard error response codes
5. **Heartbeat mechanism**: Detect dead connections proactively

## Performance & Scalability

### Q27: What are the performance bottlenecks in this application?
**Answer:**
1. **Linear search**: Finding recipients in Vector is O(n)
2. **Thread creation overhead**: Creating new thread for each client
3. **Synchronization**: Vector synchronization can cause contention
4. **Blocking I/O**: Threads wait for I/O operations
5. **String parsing**: StringTokenizer for every message

### Q28: How would you optimize message lookup?
**Answer:**
```java
// Current: O(n) linear search
for (CommunicationHandler e : loggedInClients) {
    if (e.name.equalsIgnoreCase(recipient)) { ... }
}

// Optimized: O(1) hash lookup
ConcurrentHashMap<String, CommunicationHandler> clientMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
CommunicationHandler recipient = clientMap.get(recipientName);
```

### Q29: How would you implement connection pooling?
**Answer:**
```java
// Use ThreadPoolExecutor
ExecutorService threadPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(100);

// In server accept loop
Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();
threadPool.submit(new CommunicationHandler(socket));
```

2. **No encryption**: Messages sent in plain text
3. **No input validation**: Malicious input could cause issues
4. **No rate limiting**: Spam/DoS attacks possible
5. **Name collision**: Multiple clients can use same name

### Q31: How would you add authentication?
**Answer:**
1. **Login protocol**: Username/password verification
2. **Session tokens**: JWT or session-based authentication
3. **Database integration**: Store user credentials
4. **SSL/TLS**: Encrypt authentication data
```java
// Example authentication flow
public boolean authenticateUser(String username, String password) {
    return userDatabase.validateCredentials(username, password);
}
```

### Q32: How would you implement message encryption?
**Answer:**
```java
// SSL Socket example
SSLServerSocketFactory factory = (SSLServerSocketFactory) SSLServerSocketFactory.getDefault();
ServerSocket serverSocket = factory.createServerSocket(port);

// Or manual encryption
String encryptedMessage = AESUtil.encrypt(message, secretKey);
```
